## Project Title

Healthcare expenditure patterns in U.S. as compared to other countries

## Project Motivation

Our goal is to compare various health-related expenditures across a
select few countries, taking a look at private vs government costs, as
well as the amount of funding received for varying categories of
conditions. How do these vary by country? What do funding and expenses
look like per capita, and for countries with varying socio-economic
status.

We chose this topic because it’s important to understand the
distribution of funding for healthcare, and compare that to the true
expenses by country to see if they are receiving sufficient resources.
Several countries rely on the WHO for healthcare, treatment, and
research funding, and so it’s important to note where there are gaps,
and where most costs lie, whether it be on primary health care or
infectious diseases or noncommunicable diseases.

## Intended Final Products

Out of Pocket Costs vs. Government Insurance vs. Private Insurance

## Data Source

The Global Health Expenditure Database:
<https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/Index/en>

An open access database which provides internationally comparable data
on health spending from 2000 to 2018 This database helps to monitor
availability of health resources and extent to which these resources are
utilized equitably and efficiently.
